        <h2>Your Guide to Join</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Welcome to the support page for <a href="index.html">Join</a>, your all-in-one assistant for managing tasks
            and team
            projects with clarity and ease.
            This guide walks you through what <a href="index.html">Join</a> is, what it offers, and how to get started.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="font-size-35px">What is Join?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            <a href="index.html">Join</a> is a visual project management application built around the <em>kanban
                method</em>.
            Developed by students at the Developer Akademie during an intensive web development program, it offers a
            modern, intuitive interface to help teams stay organized.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Kanban</strong> – a method originating from Japan – is based on managing work via visual boards.
            It’s all about improving flow, avoiding overload, and keeping priorities visible at all times.
            With <a href="index.html">Join</a>, this concept is translated into a simple and effective digital tool for
            managing your
            daily
            tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please keep in mind that <a href="index.html">Join</a> was created for learning purposes. It may not meet
            all standards
            required for
            large-scale commercial use.
            While we aim for a smooth experience, occasional bugs or downtimes may occur.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="font-size-35px">Getting Started</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>Navigating the Board</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            When you open <a href="index.html">Join</a>, you'll land on your kanban board. This board is your workspace
            and includes four
            predefined columns:
            <strong>To Do</strong>, <strong>In Progress</strong>, <strong>Await Feedback</strong>, and
            <strong>Done</strong>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Managing Contacts</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            To work with others, head over to the <strong>Contacts</strong> area. Click on <em>“New Contact”</em>,
            fill in the required details, and you're ready to assign tasks to your team members.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Creating Tasks (Cards)</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            Tasks are displayed as cards within the board. To add one, just click the <strong>plus (+)</strong> icon in
            the column
            where the task should start. Enter the task name, details, deadline, and assign the responsible team
            members.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Updating Task Progress</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            Move cards across the board as work progresses. Simply <strong>drag and drop</strong> the card into the
            appropriate column – easy and visual.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Removing Tasks</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            Finished a task or added one by mistake? You can either move it to <strong>“Done”</strong> or delete it.
            <em>Note: Deleting is permanent and can’t be undone.</em>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="font-size-35px">Tips for Success</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            For the best results, keep your board updated regularly and ensure your team follows the workflow.
            A well-maintained board means less confusion and better collaboration.
